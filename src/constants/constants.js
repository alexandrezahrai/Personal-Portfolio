      "Who doesn't like having a little fun? The game of Pig is a very simple dice game in which two players battle to reach 100 points. Each turn, a player repeatedly rolls a die until either a 1 is rolled or the player holds and scores the sum of the rolls. If a player holds, their turn total is added to their total score and it becomes the opponents turn. The goal of this project was to apply my JavaScript knowledge as well as utilizing Sass instead of pure CSS. I am very pleased with the result and hope you are, too!",
